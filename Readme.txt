This directory includes an ensemble of matlab and R codes. 

The codes are developed for the computation of the following causality measures: 

1. transfer entropy (TE):  TE.m

2. partial transfer entropy (PTE): PTE.m

3. eight (8) connectivity-based variants of PTE (1A - 4B): connectivity_basedPTEvariants.m

4. three (3) RF-based variants of PTE (5A - 5C): RF_basedPTEvarinats.m
   (where RF stands for Random Forests)

The p-values of the null hypothesis H0: no causality, are extracted from an one-sided test on 'nsur' time shifted 
surrogates (randomizing the driving time series).

All measures are computed using the k-nearest neighbors' (KNN) estimator 
(Kraskov, A., St√∂gbauer, H., & Grassberger, P. (2004). Estimating mutual information. Physical review E, 69(6), 066138).

Please cite the following paper if you use the corresponding code for estimating Partial Transfer Entropy based on the KNN estimator:

Analysis. International Journal of Bifurcation and Chaos, 22 (9), 1250222, 2012.

The auxiliary codes are necessary to run the above matlab functions.

The descripition of the PTE variants can be found in:
